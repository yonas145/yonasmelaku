Ethiopia is a nation with a long, venerable and complex history. Although located in the tropics its high altitudes give much of it a temperate climate.

Although the ancient, aboriginal population of what is now Ethiopia were Cushitic language speakers, the culture that came to be identified with Ethiopia came from Arabia, probably as early as 1000 B.C. These Semitic language speakers adopted Christianity in the fourth century A.D. The particular version of Christianity adopted by the Ethiopians was called monophysite because it maintained that Jesus of Nazareth was of a single nature rather than of two natures, divine and human, as maintained by the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. The other monophysite Christian organizations were the Coptic church of Egypt, the Syrian church and the Armenian church. Now the monophysite churches are accepted as orthodox but in the Middle Ages these theological issues were considered vitally important.

With the advent of Islam there was a political upheaval as well as a religious one in the region. The Christians of Ethiopia initially had good relations with the converts to the new religion of Islam. A party of converts to Islam in Arabia fled persecution across the Red Sea. They sought and received refuge from the Ethiopian Christians. Jesus is a revered figure in Islam, having the status of a Prophet. The Koran mandates tolerance for the People of the Book; i.e., Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians. So initially there was no friction between the Muslims and the Christians. But later political rivalries manifested themselves as religious conflicts.

Haile Selassie-When one considers the extraordinary career of Ras Tafari, later known as Haile Selassie, one wonders whether a writer of fiction would dare to create a character who had such an improbable life. Ras Tafari (the Ras is an honorific roughly meaning prince) was the son of Ras Mekonen of the eastern city of Harer. His line was descended from a king of Shewa, the region around what is now the capital, Addis Ababa. Shewa was to the south of the traditional homeland of the ruling class, the Habesha, and many felt that the Shewa nobility were not pure Habesha but a mixture of Habesha and Oromo. This was a factor in the dynastic politics of Ethiopia.

The southern areas of what is now Ethiopia were conquered in the late 19th century by the Emperor Menelik II who created the new capital of Addis Ababa (new flower) in Shewa. This conquest brought non-Habesha people, primarily the Oromo, into the empire and created a distinction between the north and the south in terms of people and institutions.

The Committee was commonly called the Derg, meaning the Committee. Mengistu was chairman and Atnafu vice chairman. Prime ministers continued to be appointed but the real power resided in the Derg.

By July the Derg was in complete control. The original organizer of the Committee, Colonel Zewd, fled. By September the Derg formally deposed Haile Selassie and placed him under arrest. On September 15th a new council, the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) was formed with General Aman as chairman. General Aman was an Eritrean and major commander of Ethiopian forces during the war against Somalia. Aman tried to block the issuance by the Derg of new laws mandating capital punishment for political offenses against the Derg
The government took majority ownership of 29 other enterprises. The government did not take control of retail and wholesale trade nor the import and export industries.
Although there was not necessarily wide support for socialism per se there was general acknowledgement of a need for land reform. The global experience with land reform is that the results are usually disappointing as far as achieving the intended results. Nevertheless the Derg on March 4, 1975 declared.
During this era the Derg attempted to counter the insurgency in the north by a program of forced resettlement to the south. The public justification for this resettlement was to remove agriculturalists from the drought-stricken, land-short north to the more amply watered land to the south. The real reason for this resettlement was to deprive the rebels in the north of support from the farm families. The resettlement was however haphazard and uncoordinated. Sometimes the resettlees were simply people the army conscripted from the market places. Women would be taken from the market place and sent south without even the opportunity to say goodbye to their children. In the south the resettlement camps were poorly organized and the resettlees left without the necessary resources to survive.

When the rebel forces of the EPLF and TPLF surrounded Addis Ababa in 1991 the Ethiopian army collapsed as a military force. Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe, one of the few countries which would grant him asylum, with a considerable fortune.

True to the conditions for the cooperation of the EPLF the leadership of the new regime of the EPRDF in Addis Ababa allowed Eritrea to become independent in 1993. But the defeat of Mengistu's Marxist-Leninist government did not mean Ethiopia had abandoned socialism. The EPRDF was ideologically committed to Marxist-Leninist socialism but it was desperately in need of foreign aid and the aid-givers said, "No democracy, no aid." Meles and the Tigrayan core of the new regime moderated their Marxist-Leninism but from time to time it breaks out again. For the election of 1995 the regime banned regional-ethnic parties which were not part of the EPRDF coalition. In April of 2001 when university students demonstrated for academic freedom the regime shot about one hundred.
During the period of the revolution it is remarkable that Ethiopia had any economy. The basic economy was agricultural. Upwards of eighty percent of the population is directly or indirectly dependent upon agriculture for their livelihood. Although an overwhelming proportion of the population are engaged in agriculture, agricultural production accounts for only about 50 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Most of the farming (two thirds to three quarters) is for the subsistence of the rural population and consists primarily of subsistence crops such as grains and pulses.
